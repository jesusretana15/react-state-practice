# USE STATE PRACTICE 

Overview

Welcome to the Interactive Box Shapes project, an engaging and dynamic application built with React! This project features a series of interactive boxes that change their style when clicked. The primary goal is to demonstrate the use of React’s useState hook for managing state in a functional component.

Features

	•	Interactive Elements: Click on any box to toggle its state and see the visual change.
	•	Dynamic State Management: Utilizes React’s useState hook to efficiently manage the state of each box.
	•	Reusable Components: Each box is a reusable component, making the codebase clean and modular.

Technologies Used

	•	React: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
	•	JavaScript (ES6+): Modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals.
	•	CSS: Styling the components for a visually appealing layout.
